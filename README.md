# nightterror
NightTerrorJS is a high-level browser automation library based on <a href="https://github.com/YZYLAB/dream-js">DreamJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare">NightmareJS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/unlight/nightmare-xpath">NightmareXPATH</a>.
NightTerror is composed of elements from each, with my additional original code, creating a stronger and more efficient library.

## What does Nightterror have to offer?
- `.xpath()` native method and support. [NightmareXPATH]
- Removed uneccesary annotations, comments, and documentation from scripts. [NightTerrorJS]
- Uses ESM modules instead of CJS. [DreamJS]
- Extra added security to make the webscraper less detectable [DreamJS]
- Fixed broken scripts and evluation mechanics from DreamJS [NightTerrorJS]

## Install for NodeJS
```css
npm i nightterror
```
